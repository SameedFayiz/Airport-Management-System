The project titled "Airport Management System" was developed as a complex engineering problem for the course CS-222 Database Management System in the 4th semester of the Computer & Information Systems department at NED University of Engineering and Technology.

The Airport Management System project encompasses all the essential functionalities required to effectively manage an airport. 
It is designed to handle various aspects of airport operations and provide a user-friendly interface for administrators to perform their tasks efficiently.

To setup the project run the following commands: 
#python -m venv virt 
#virt\Scripts\activate 
#pip install django 
#pip install mysql 
#pip install django-jazzmin 

#Then, run the server by the following command:
#python manage.py makemigrations 
#python manage.py migrate 
#python manage.py runserver

To access the project's database, you can visit the website: https://www.db4free.net/phpMyAdmin/. Please use the following credentials to log in:

Username: dbmsproject
Password: DBMSProject

The admin panel has been intentionally kept hidden to ensure stringent security standards and allow for future expansion of the project. 
By concealing the admin panel, the system is safeguarded against unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities. 
This approach enables the project to be enhanced and extended with additional features and functionalities in the near future.
